# Microfluidic-device-control-code
The code I optimized and edited for summer 2017. Uses a feedback loop with 4 pressure controllers and a DAQ card to control a soft-particle suspension microfluidic system. Basic Computer vision is applied in order to find the particle, and an analytical solution to the flow field is calculated. This solution gives rise to a stagnation point, which can be controlled to study the behavior of these soft particles in this suspension. Original thesis credits to Ali.
